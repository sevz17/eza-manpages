.SH NAME
.PP
eza — a modern replacement for ls


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCeza [options] [files...]\fR

.PP
\fBeza\fP is a modern replacement for \fB\fCls\fR\&.
It uses colours for information by default, helping you distinguish between many types of files, such as whether you are the owner, or in the owning group.

.PP
It also has extra features not present in the original \fB\fCls\fR, such as viewing the Git status for a directory, or recursing into directories with a tree view.


.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fB\fCeza\fR
Lists the contents of the current directory in a grid.

.TP
\fB\fCeza --oneline --reverse --sort=size\fR
Displays a list of files with the largest at the top.

.TP
\fB\fCeza --long --header --inode --git\fR
Displays a table of files with a header, showing each file’s metadata, inode, and Git status.

.TP
\fB\fCeza --long --tree --level=3\fR
Displays a tree of files, three levels deep, as well as each file’s metadata.


.SH META OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\fC--help\fR
Show list of command-line options.

.TP
\fB\fC-v\fR, \fB\fC--version\fR
Show version of eza.


.SH DISPLAY OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\fC-1\fR, \fB\fC--oneline\fR
Display one entry per line.

.TP
\fB\fC-F\fR, \fB\fC--classify\fR
Display file kind indicators next to file names.

.TP
\fB\fC-G\fR, \fB\fC--grid\fR
Display entries as a grid (default).

.TP
\fB\fC-l\fR, \fB\fC--long\fR
Display extended file metadata as a table.

.TP
\fB\fC-R\fR, \fB\fC--recurse\fR
Recurse into directories.

.TP
\fB\fC-T\fR, \fB\fC--tree\fR
Recurse into directories as a tree.

.TP
\fB\fC-X\fR, \fB\fC--dereference\fR
Dereference symbolic links when displaying information.

.TP
\fB\fC-x\fR, \fB\fC--across\fR
Sort the grid across, rather than downwards.

.TP
\fB\fC--color=WHEN\fR, \fB\fC--colour=WHEN\fR
When to use terminal colours (using ANSI escape code to colorize the output).

.PP
Valid settings are ‘\fB\fCalways\fR’, ‘\fB\fCautomatic\fR’ (or ‘\fB\fCauto\fR’ for short), and ‘\fB\fCnever\fR’.
The default value is ‘\fB\fCautomatic\fR’.

.PP
The default behavior (‘\fB\fCautomatic\fR’ or ‘\fB\fCauto\fR’) is to colorize the output only when the standard output is connected to a real terminal. If the output of \fB\fCeza\fR is redirected to a file or piped into another program, terminal colors will not be used. Setting this option to ‘\fB\fCalways\fR’ causes \fB\fCeza\fR to always output terminal color, while ‘\fB\fCnever\fR’ disables the use of terminal color.

.PP
Manually setting this option overrides \fB\fCNO_COLOR\fR environment.

.TP
\fB\fC--color-scale\fR, \fB\fC--colour-scale\fR
highlight levels of \fB\fCfield\fR distinctly.
Use comma(,) separated list of all, age, size

.TP
\fB\fC--color-scale-mode\fR, \fB\fC--colour-scale-mode\fR
Use gradient or fixed colors in \fB\fC--color-scale\fR\&.

.PP
Valid options are \fB\fCfixed\fR or \fB\fCgradient\fR\&.
The default value is \fB\fCgradient\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\fC--icons=WHEN\fR
Display icons next to file names.

.PP
Valid settings are ‘\fB\fCalways\fR’, ‘\fB\fCautomatic\fR’ (‘\fB\fCauto\fR’ for short), and ‘\fB\fCnever\fR’.
The default value is ‘\fB\fCautomatic\fR’.

.PP
\fB\fCautomatic\fR or \fB\fCauto\fR will display icons only when the standard output is connected to a real terminal. If \fB\fCeza\fR is ran while in a \fB\fCtty\fR, or the output of \fB\fCeza\fR is either redirected to a file or piped into another program, icons will not be used. Setting this option to ‘\fB\fCalways\fR’ causes \fB\fCeza\fR to always display icons, while ‘\fB\fCnever\fR’ disables the use of icons.

.TP
\fB\fC--no-quotes\fR
Don't quote file names with spaces.

.TP
\fB\fC--hyperlink\fR
Display entries as hyperlinks

.TP
\fB\fC-w\fR, \fB\fC--width=COLS\fR

.PP
Valid options are \fB\fCnone\fR, \fB\fCabsolute\fR or \fB\fCrelative\fR\&.
The default value is \fB\fCnone\fR

.PP

Directories will be shown to have the status of their contents, which is how ‘deleted’ is possible if a directory contains a file that has a certain status, it will be shown to have that status.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
If an environment variable prefixed with \fB\fCEZA_\fR is not set, for backward compatibility, it will default to its counterpart starting with \fB\fCEXA_\fR\&.

.PP
eza responds to the following environment variables:

.SH \fB\fCCOLUMNS\fR
.PP
Overrides the width of the terminal, in characters, however, \fB\fC-w\fR takes precedence.

.PP
For example, ‘\fB\fCCOLUMNS=80 eza\fR’ will show a grid view with a maximum width of 80 characters.

.PP
This option won’t do anything when eza’s output doesn’t wrap, such as when using the \fB\fC--long\fR view.

.SH \fB\fCEZA_STRICT\fR
.PP
Enables \fIstrict mode\fP, which will make eza error when two command-line options are incompatible.

.PP
Usually, options can override each other going right-to-left on the command line, so that eza can be given aliases: creating an alias ‘\fB\fCeza=eza --sort=ext\fR’ then running ‘\fB\fCeza --sort=size\fR’ with that alias will run ‘\fB\fCeza --sort=ext --sort=size\fR’, and the sorting specified by the user will override the sorting specified by the alias.

.PP
In strict mode, the two options will not co-operate, and eza will error.

.PP
This option is intended for use with automated scripts and other situations where you want to be certain you’re typing in the right command.

.SH \fB\fCEZA_GRID_ROWS\fR
.PP
Limits the grid-details view (‘\fB\fCeza --grid --long\fR’) so it’s only activated when at least the given number of rows of output would be generated.

.PP
With widescreen displays, it’s possible for the grid to look very wide and sparse, on just one or two lines with none of the columns lining up.
By specifying a minimum number of rows, you can only use the view if it’s going to be worth using.

.SH \fB\fCEZA_ICON_SPACING\fR
.PP
Specifies the number of spaces to print between an icon (see the ‘\fB\fC--icons\fR’ option) and its file name.

.PP
Different terminals display icons differently, as they usually take up more than one character width on screen, so there’s no “standard” number of spaces that eza can use to separate an icon from text. One space may place the icon too close to the text, and two spaces may place it too far away. So the choice is left up to the user to configure depending on their terminal emulator.

.SH \fB\fCNO_COLOR\fR
.PP
Disables colours in the output (regardless of its value). Can be overridden by \fB\fC--color\fR option.

.PP
See \fB\fChttps://no-color.org/\fR for details.

.SH \fB\fCLS_COLORS\fR, \fB\fCEZA_COLORS\fR
.PP
Specifies the colour scheme used to highlight files based on their name and kind, as well as highlighting metadata and parts of the UI.

.PP
For more information on the format of these environment variables, see the eza_colors.5.md
\[la]eza_colors.5.md\[ra] manual page.

.SH \fB\fCEZA_OVERRIDE_GIT\fR
.PP
Overrides any \fB\fC--git\fR or \fB\fC--git-repos\fR argument

.SH \fB\fCEZA_MIN_LUMINANCE\fR
.PP
Specifies the minimum luminance to use when decay is active. It's value can be between -100 to 100.

.SH \fB\fCEZA_ICONS_AUTO\fR
.PP
If set, automates the same behavior as using \fB\fC--icons\fR or \fB\fC--icons=auto\fR\&. Useful for if you always want to have icons enabled.

.PP
Any explicit use of the \fB\fC--icons=WHEN\fR flag overrides this behavior.


.SH EXIT STATUSES
.TP
0
If everything goes OK.

.TP
1
If there was an I/O error during operation.

.TP
3
If there was a problem with the command-line arguments.
